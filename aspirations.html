                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <p>In the short term, I plan to reflect on my career journey and evaluate the next steps as I approach
                        graduation. This time offers an opportunity to carefully consider my professional path and prepare
                        for the transition into the workforce. I aim to stay up to date with tech news, as the field is
                        rapidly evolving and constantly changing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, I will dedicate more time to my personal interests, particularly climbing, as it brings
                        me both relaxation and personal growth outside of work. I hope to challenge myself with more
                        advanced climbing techniques and explore new routes while also connecting with the wider climbing
                        community. Throughout this period, I will prioritise my physical and mental wellbeing by engaging in
                        activities that provide balance and joy, ensuring a smooth and fulfilling transition from education
                        to career.</p>

                <h2>Medium-term Goals</h2>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <p>In the medium term, I aim to secure a full-time position in data analytics, where I can leverage the
                        skills I've developed during my internship and further enhance my technical expertise. I plan to gain
                        proficiency in advanced data tools like Tableau and Python, which will allow me to contribute to
                        meaningful projects that drive data-driven decisions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, I want to explore opportunities to expand my knowledge in other areas of data science
                        and analytics, whether through certifications or hands-on experience, to position myself as a
                        well-rounded professional in the field. This will not only contribute to my growth but also ensure I
                        add significant value to the organisations I work with.</p>

                <h2>Long-term Vision</h2>
                <div class="timeline-content">
                    <p>Looking further ahead, my long-term vision is to establish myself as a trusted and expert data
                        professional, with the ability to lead impactful data-driven initiatives within a dynamic
                        organisation. I aspire to take on more leadership roles, managing teams and projects that use data
                        to solve complex problems.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also see myself continuing to learn and adapt to new trends in the ever-evolving field of data
                        science, ensuring that I remain at the forefront of technological advancements. Ultimately, I hope
                        to integrate my technical career with my personal interests, like climbing and crocheting, creating
                        a fulfilling balance between my work and passions that allows me to pursue a well-rounded and
                        meaningful life.</p>
