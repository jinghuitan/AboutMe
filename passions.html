                <div class="content">
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>I started swimming more seriously after joining the Lifesaving CCA in poly. As a
                            non-swimmer, I received guidance from dedicated coaches who helped me develop proper
                            techniques,
                            as well as lifesaving skills. Once I mastered the basics and approval from coaches, I
                            progressed to earning certificates to become a qualified lifeguard:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lifesaving 1, 2 and 3: The prerequisite for Bronze Medallion. It tests on basic water
                                safety, land-based rescue and water rescue</li>
                            <li>Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): To provide practical experience in the
                                lifesaving techniques of CPR and related emergency care.</li>
                            <li>Bronze Medallion: To establish an advanced standard of all round knowledge, skills
                                and ability in aquatic rescue situations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Being part of this CCA made me realise how much I enjoy swimming. It has become my
                            favourite way to relax and clear my mind, and I always feel refreshed after a swim, no
                            matter how my day goes.</p>

                <h2>Climbing</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>I began committing to my climbing journey, mainly on bouldering, in May 2024, and since then,
                            I've been
                            climbing regularly. I discovered the joy of bouldering through the sense of accomplishment I
                            feel after
                            clearing a route. Climbing challenges me both physically and mentally, each route requires
                            problem-solving
                            and pushing my limits, whether it's strength, technique, or perseverance. I enjoy the mental
                            engagement
                            as I figure out how to overcome the obstacles in front of me, while also improving my focus
                            and
                            determination. I've been sharing my climbs on Instagram <a
                                href="https://www.instagram.com/tofu.blok" target="_blank"
                                class="insta-link">@tofu.blok</a> as a way to document my journey, giving me the
                            chance to look back and reflect on how far I've come.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Fuelled by my love for climbing, I decided to apply as a service crew member at fit · bloc.
                            This role
                            has helped me develop strong communication skills through constant interaction with
                            customers. It has
                            also enhanced my flexibility and adaptability. Sometimes, it's not enough to follow the
                            manual, as
                            customers often have unique requests that require quick thinking and creative solutions.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Climbing has truly brought about a significant change in my life. I've never felt such
                            eagerness to look
                            forward to something before. It is now a part of my life that I can't live without.</p>

                <h2>Crocheting</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>Crocheting has become a beloved hobby of mine, offering the perfect blend of creativity and
                            relaxation. I started with small projects like dolls' clothes and amigurumi, as I find it easier
                            to commit to them since they don't take too long to finish. However, I hope to challenge myself
                            with larger projects in the future.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>One of my most significant projects is the sleeve I crocheted for my chalk bag. Tired of its
                            original colour, I decided to add a custom sleeve. Inspired by Jellycat's toilet paper amusable,
                            I recreated a design that now makes my chalk bag a unique and trusted climbing companion.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Crocheting also helps me unwind, as the repetitive motions are calming. It's always rewarding to
                            transform a simple ball of yarn into something full of character and personality.</p>
